"GINO is built on top of SQLAlchemy core, your tables are 100% compatible "
"with vanilla SQLAlchemy, using Alembic_ for example. GINO defined its own "
"``Engine`` and ``Connection`` API for asynchronous programming, as well as "
"an asynchronous dialect API for adapting non-DB-API asynchronous database "
"connectors, asyncpg_ for example. On top of such core, GINO offered an "
"object abstraction API for simple CRUD operations."
